In this mini project I try to explain the importance of debounce which can help you control the frequency of function calls and avoid issues.

## What is Debouncing?
Debouncing is a technique used to control the frequency of function calls. It operates by introducing a delay in the execution of a function until a specified period of time elapses without any additional function calls. If another function call occurs during this waiting period, the timer is reset, and the function's execution is postponed once more.

Debouncing proves advantageous in scenarios where there's a need to restrict the frequency of function invocation, including:

- Managing user input events, such as keypresses, mouse movements, or button clicks.

- Handling resource-intensive tasks or network requests that don't warrant execution with every function call.
